Level 400
Add a Show Selector
Pre-req: For this level you will have to have learned to use fetch() to GET JSON content from an API.

Complete all requirements from level 300
Add a select input which allows you to choose which show you are interested in
When a show is selected, your app should display the episodes for that show as per the earlier levels of this challenge, except that it should first fetch the episode list from the API - see below
You can get the list of shows by loading shows.js in your index.html and using the provided function: getAllShows()
Ensure that your search and episode selector controls still work correctly when you switch shows.
This show select must list shows in alphabetical order, case-insensitive.
Note on fetching episode lists
Once the user selects a show you should fetch the episodes list using URLs of the following pattern:

https://api.tvmaze.com/shows/SHOW_ID/episodes where SHOW_ID should be replaced with the numeric id of the selected show.

For example, https://api.tvmaze.com/shows/82/episodes will return the episodes for show 82 ("Game of Thrones").
