// fetch the shows from the website

we have been working on our tv project for the last four weeks.

today we will be presenting two of our projects along with our user stories

the user stories that we have created for the project are:

Level 100
As a user, I want to see all the episodes from all the seasons displayed on the homepage so that I can choose the episode that I want. I would want each episode to have a title, season number, episode number, summary and image.
Level 200
I want to be able to type into a search box to find the show I'm looking for, as a user.
When I type, the search should only show episodes whose names or summaries begin with or contain the letter or word I am entering.
Level 300
As a user, who wants to watch an episode, I would like to be able to select an episode from a dropdown that lets me choose from all the episodes of a show. Once selected, I want to be able to see only the episode which I have selected.

Ansu will give you the next user stories
